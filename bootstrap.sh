# Description:  This is a script which I wrote to assist in generating
#               all of the build environment for this project. This
#               includes generating the configure script so that the
#               standard ./configure && make && make install build
#               sequence can be used.

#aclocal
#autoheader
#autoconf
#automake --add-missing

# The above has now been replaced by autoreconf

autoreconf -i
